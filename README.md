# Base Code for Lab Assignment 4

Take a careful look at the models and their associations.
Then head to the `db/seed.rb` file and look at the models that are created initially.

Add validators to your models and try them out in the rails console.

Finally, add the necessary callbacks to the `Ticket` class. You will see that there is some starter code for a callback handler.
